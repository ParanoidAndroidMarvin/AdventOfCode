Advent of Code solutions 2021
This repository contains the puzzle solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in Python.
I am happy about any feedback as I took this opportunity to start learning some Python and am therefore still a complete noob!

# Get Started
1. Create local.py in project root and add your AOC session key in that file:
`session = 7sb36tzbubljmclr71qgebfrfp9iozhzsj7ase4s`
2. Run main.py and you should see a console menu where you can select the daily puzzles (select with up and down keys)
3. Press Enter to run the selected puzzle
4. To return to menu press backspace
5. Close console application with Escape
